## Setup

Be sure to use `npm` version `18.5.0`

To setup the project, create a `.env` file and set the required environment variables. Sensible defaults can be found in `.env.example`.

Run

```bash
npm run start
```

That's it. The app uses SQLite, so no need for an external database. Nothing will be installed globally.

## Docs

`SwaggerUI` documentation is available on the `/docs` url.

Postman collection also available in the `ffm.postman_collection.json` file.

## Tests

To run tests, run

```bash
npm run test
```
